Steganography hides the existence of the data; encryption protects the content.
‚úÖ GUI app for Windows ‚Ä¢ Optional CLI ‚Ä¢ Lossless output for reliable extraction.

Hide encrypted messages or files inside images/videos with password-protected, pixel-level steganography.

**Note on security**: Even if you use a weak password such as "hello", an attacker who doesn‚Äôt know there‚Äôs anything hidden may not look for it. That‚Äôs the beauty of steganography ‚Äî security through obscurity at the visual/statistical level.
However, if the adversary suspects steganography and runs tools like StegExpose or Chi-square tests, weakly protected data can be detected, even if not decrypted.

Once detected, brute-forcing a weak password becomes trivial.

üîë Real-world recommendation
Use case	                                                Recommended password policy
Personal / casual hiding (fun, non-sensitive)	            fine to use ‚Äúhello‚Äù
Private messages / personal data	                        at least 12 random chars (e.g. Tr9!bzK4E1hJ)
Sensitive work / research / political / corporate data	  16+ random chars or a Diceware passphrase (e.g. orbit-tiger-vivid-                                                            salsa-dune-puzzle)
National-level secrecy	                                  Use keyfile + secure out-of-band exchange

If you prefer to run directly in CLI, here are some examples:
```
# embed text into an image
python stego_cli.py embed -i cover.png -o cover_stego.png -p "secret" -m "Hello"

# extract (prints UTF-8 to stdout or writes binary with --out)
python stego_cli.py extract -i cover_stego.png -p "secret"
```
